revprefdescription,"<p>A review preference is a small integer that indicates how much you want to review a paper. Positive numbers mean you want to review the paper, negative numbers mean you don’t, and −100 means you think you have a conflict. −20 to 20 is a typical range for real preferences; multiple papers can have the same preference. The automatic assignment algorithm attempts to assign reviews in descending preference order. Different users’ preference values are not compared and need not use the same scale.</p>
