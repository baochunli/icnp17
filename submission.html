      <h1>Paper Submission</h1>
      <br />
      <p>The 25th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP 2017)</p>
      <p>Toronto, October 10-13, 2017</p>
    </div>

    <h1 id="contents">Contents</h1>

  <h2 id="toc_0">Important Dates</h2>
  
  <p>Full paper submission: May 15, 2017 (11:59 p.m. EDT) <strong>(hard deadline)</strong></p>

  <h2 id="toc_0">Submission Guidelines</h2>

  <p>All submitted papers must:</p>

  <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
  <li>Have a title and abstract of no more than 250 words.</li>

  <li>Have the names and affiliations of authors removed.</li>
  
  <li>Have no more than 10 pages (including everything) with at least 10 point font and adhere to the IEEE formatting requirements. For LaTeX, use the <strong>conference</strong> option.</li>
  
  <li>Be submitted using the official ICNP 2017 submission page. Link to the submission page: <a href="http://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/icnp17/hotcrp/">http://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/icnp17/hotcrp/</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please read the following detailed instructions carefully.</p>

  <h3 id="toc_1">Format and Length</h3>

  <p>Submitted papers must be written in English and have no more than ten (10) pages in double-column format with standard margins and at least a 10 point font. This length includes everything: figures, tables, references, appendices and so forth. Longer submissions will not be reviewed. Papers should include a title and an abstract of fewer than 250 words.</p>

  <p>All papers must be formatted for printing on US letter (8.5&quot; by 11&quot;) size paper and must adhere to the IEEE formatting requirements. For LaTeX, use the <strong>conference</strong> option. The template should be used as is. Papers that violate the template, <i>e.g.</i>, by picking narrower line-spacing or margins than what the template defines, may be rejected without review.</p>

  <p>Papers must be submitted in PDF (Portable Document Format) and be compatible with Acrobat (English version), not including any special characters or non-standard fonts. We must be able to display and print your submission exactly as we receive it and using only standard tools and postscript printers, so we strongly suggest that you use only standard fonts. Make sure that the paper prints well on black-and-white printers, not color printers. This is especially true for plots and graphs in the paper.</p>

  <h3 id="toc_2">Anonymity</h3>

  <p>ICNP uses a double-blind review process. The identity of authors and referees will not be revealed to each other. To ensure double-blind reviewing, author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper; bibliographic references should be made in such a way as to preserve author anonymity; acknowledgement with identifiable names and funding sources should be removed. Note that own work should be cited as a third person. Papers violating this double-blind review policy will be rejected without review. Note that double-blind violations are sometimes not discovered until well into the review process, so authors are strongly advised to heed the above requirements at submission time.</p>

  <h3 id="toc_3">Conflicts</h3>

  <p>Authors need to indicate on their paper&#39;s submission page all TPC members with whom they have conflicts of interest. An author and a TPC member have a conflict of interest if one of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) They are currently employed at the same institution, or they have been employed at the same institution within the last 12 months, or they are going to be employment at the same institution within the next 6 months. (2) The author and the TPC member had an advisor-advisee relationship. (3) The author and the TPC member have collaborated on a project, a publication, or a grant proposal within the past 4 years. (4) The author and the TPC member have family relationship or are close personal friend. Authors should not improperly identify TPC members as conflicts to avoid individuals who might review their papers.</p>

  <h3 id="toc_4">Dual Submissions</h3>

  <p>Once submitted to ICNP, a paper cannot be submitted to another workshop, conference or journal until the ICNP acceptance decision is known. To do so is to risk wasting one of our community&#39;s scarcest resources: reviewer effort. Similarly, a paper that is under consideration elsewhere, including a workshop or journal, cannot simultaneously be submitted to ICNP. It is acceptable if some of the material in a submission appeared in a workshop only if the paper submitted to ICNP provides substantial additional results compared to the earlier or pending publication.</p>

  <h3 id="toc_5">Registration and Presentation</h3>

  <p>Every paper <strong>must</strong> be presented by an author at the conference. The author list <strong>must</strong> remain the same as when the paper was submitted for review, and any changes in the author list or title is forbidden without prior written permission from the TPC Co-Chairs. At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to register at the full rate of the conference and to present the paper at the conference, in order for the paper to appear in the conference proceedings and be submitted to the IEEE digital library. Papers not presented by an author at the conference will not be published in the proceedings or submitted for inclusion in the IEEE digital library. It is the authors’ responsibility to procure the necessary visas etc. in time to attend the conference. Authors will be informed of acceptance well in advance of the conference (and provided with invitation letters, if applicable). Authors should start the process immediately upon notification of acceptance.</p>

  <h3 id="toc_6">Submission</h3>

  <p>All papers must be submitted using the ICNP 2017 submission page. To begin the process, take the following steps:</p>
